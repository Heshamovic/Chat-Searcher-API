# REST API

The system allows creating new applications where each application will have a token (generated by the system) and a name (provided by the client). The token is the identifier that devices use to send chats to that application. The token is returned in the application creation request.

Each application can have many chats. Each chat has a number. Numbering of chats in each application starts from 1 and no 2 chats in the same application may have the same number. The number of the chat is returned in the chat creation request.

A chat contains messages and messages have numbers that start from 1 for each chat. The number of the message is returned in the message creation request.

The application is identified by its token and the chat by
its number along with the application token.

You can search through messages of a specific chat. Searching is done by partially matching messages’ bodies.

Each application has a field called chats_count that contains the number of chats for this application. Similarly, the chats has a field called messages_count that contains the number of messages in this chat.
